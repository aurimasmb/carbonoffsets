_Notes on Climate Care carbon offsets retailer._

Email to Climate Care:

Questions:

* List of actual projects that are being funded?
* Which offset standards?
* Vintage of carbon offsets (are they already issued and verified?)
* Proof of retirement?
* Can we see serial numbers?

Major concerns: 

* Portfolio is not very diverse (only 4 projects, and only 1 of them has complete and uncontested information.)
* Price is a bit high?
