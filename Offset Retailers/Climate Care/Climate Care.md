Questions:

* List of actual projects that are being funded?
* Which offset standards?
* Vintage of carbon offsets (are they already issued and verified?)
* Proof of retirement?
* Can we see serial numbers?

Major concerns: 

* Portfolio is not very diverse (only 4 projects, and only 1 of them has complete and uncontested information.)
* Price is a bit high?

Status: waiting on reply.

>Dear Climate Care carbon offsets team,

>We are two recent grantees of the Fulbright programme, a United States government-sponsored academic exchange program. We are currently researching ways in which our 2016-2017 cohort can offset our flight emissions from our travel over this past year. We are currently reviewing carbon offset retailers. We wondered if you might be able to clarify a few points on your individual carbon offset programme:

>1. Is it possible to specify which projects we are purchasing offsets from? If not, will the offsets purchased now be exclusively from the four projects listed on the 2017 mixed portfolio page?
a.  How you will be addressing the Gold Standard grievance review of the LifeStraw Carbon for Water project? 
b.  Why is the Burn Stoves project not listed on the Markit registry? Is it possible to review the validation and verification info for this project elsewhere?
c.  Could you please clarify which project the “India Wind” project refers to? Is this one of the Vaayu India Wind Power projects listed on the VCS Project Database or Markit Registry? If so, could you clarify which one (Gujarat, Tamilnadu, Rajasthan, etc.)?
>2. Could you please confirm that all units being purchased have already been issued? 
>3. Would it be possible to see the serial numbers of the carbon offsets units which we are purchasing, and receive proof of retirement when these units have been retired?

>Thanks very much for your help! We look forward to being in touch.

>Kind regards,

>Aurimas Bukaukas
