# Carbon Footprint 

**Summary:**

In general the site seems a bit crappy. I want know if we can see serial numbers for the units we purchase. How do they handle retirements?

The tree planting program is not verified by any 3rd party standards, so should be treated with caution. At the moment it seems like just an expensive way to buy VCS project credits with some additional unverified activity going on in UK or Kenya with regards to tree planting. Not recommended.

Has some CDM projects, and some Gold standard projects. 

All of the projects I've looked at seem to be legit.



## Questions

1. How and when do you retire the offsets we purchase?
2. Can we see the serial numbers and proof of retirement?
3. 




With Climate Footprint you can choose to purchase offsets from:

### 1. Global Portfolio

* **Mariposas Hydroelectric Project**

http://www.vcsprojectdatabase.org/#/project_details/819

Most recent retirements are in August 2016.

Vintage is all 2011, 2012, issued in 2013.

Weird. 1 VCU was issued but never retired? http://www.vcsprojectdatabase.org/index-no-tabs.html#/vcu_details_report/81307

Who would bother with that?? Was this climate footprint just forgetting to retire someone's unit???

* **Wind Based Power Panama Winder Energy  (based in India, Asia)**

http://www.vcsprojectdatabase.org/#/project_details/1523

VCU issuance records:

http://www.vcsprojectdatabase.org/#/vcus/p_1523

these look fine. There have been some recent retirements made. some in really tiny batches of as little as 1 to 4 units.

* **YESIL Hydro Power Plant.**

YESIL Issurance History: http://www.vcsprojectdatabase.org/#/vcus/p_806

There appear to be only a very small number of VCU's available with YESIL: http://www.vcsprojectdatabase.org/index-no-tabs.html#/vcu_details_report/87815 (only 128 in that batch!)

All others already retired - the latest batch was retired in 2016 11 17.

Retirement batches are all quite small < 150 , except for one which is very large at 33,800. 

Are the small ones all Climate Footprint?

Also, all of the VCU's are from a vintage in 2009-2012. Interesting to know when Climate Footprint purchased these?


### 2. Tree Planting

Local tree planting in the UK + VCS avoided deforestation projects internationally.

There are also planting projects for Kenya. It is not clear that these adhere to any 3rd party standards, and are slightly out of scope of this research...?

Tree planting is buddied with a VCS avoided deforestation project elsewhere. 

Not clear how to vet the tree planting project.

Also this is a VERY expensive programme at $ 12.99 / tree. Climate Footprint claims that this is about 1 tree. This is only true for large mature trees at the end of their life, and is not verified by any standard. Basically you are paying for very expensive carbon offsets. Not even clear how many units you are buying from their other projects.

Ok it seems that you are getting 1 tonne of VCS-verified offsets for your $12.99. The average cost of afforestation projects however SOVCM 2017 is Â£ 6.32 = 8.23 USD. So you are paying an extra $4 / unit for unclear, unverified benefits.

### 3. Gold Standard Projects
