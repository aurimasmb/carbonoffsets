# Cool Effect

_Notes on the Cool Effect retailer._

Wow these guys are refreshing.

You can buy from individual projects.

They tell you exactly the fee that they are taking on top of the actual carbon unit cost.

They explain their project vetting process, which looks fairly rigorous but of course you can always choose the project you like best.





## Questions:

* What is the vintage of the carbon units we are purchasing??
* Does Cool Effect publish an internal financial analysis ? It seem like I'm only able to find 3rd party reviews??
* What is the Sales force system? ???
* What is the internal team of scientists at Cool Effect. Where are these documents? where is the financial model? The management analysis?

Los Santos Window Power Project:

https://mer.markit.com/br-reg/public/project.jsp?project_id=103000000007288

Why can we not see the issuance history for this project?

Why do the other projects not even show up on the Markit registry?

_Looking at 2015 990 Form Page 10 (Part IX Statement of Functional Expenses):_ 

Holy shit. They spent $984,552 on advertising and promotion in 2016. Why is this necessary? Who is paying for this?

What is the difference between this and marketing and outreach?, which cost another???? $931,178??

The vast majority of your assets are in publicly traded securities - $1,915,940. Only 17000 in cash. Also very low cost of insurance?

Net gains / losses on investments is $291,995... isn't that a lot if you only have a 2 million invested? Over 10% losses in one year?

* public relations costs 237,668


* You received 5 million ($5,087,341) in publicly traded securities as contributions. What are these? Where do they come from? Your total contributions are 6,111,840. Does that mean that you received $1,024,449 in cash, likely from your customers
?
