# Cool Effect

_Notes on the Cool Effect retailer._

Wow these guys are refreshing.

You can buy from individual projects.

They tell you exactly the fee that they are taking on top of the actual carbon unit cost.

They explain their project vetting process, which looks fairly rigorous but of course you can always choose the project you like best.


## Questions:

* What is the vintage of the carbon units we are purchasing??
