This [project](https://www.cooleffect.org/content/project/southern-ute-indian-tribe-methane-capture) captured methane from coal seams (coal bed methane) with 29 wells and funneled it into existing natural gas pipelines. The methane would have otherwise released into the atmosphere, [acting as a greenhouse gas](https://www.edf.org/methane-other-important-greenhouse-gas) and contributing to climate change. The Southern Ute tribe developed the method of capture, and although they do not currently profit off of the captured methane, the project has potential co-benefits.

The project is VCS-certified, [claiming](https://www.cooleffect.org/lib/content/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/VERIF_REP_937_01JanC2014_to_31DEC2014-3.pdf) 53,363 metric tonnes CO2-e of reduction in 2014. 

It's cool that the verification accounts for carbon emissions from project operation, so emissions from fossil fuel combustion, energy usage, etc. of the offsetting project.

Emissions reductions include both avoided methane leakage and reduction of fossil-fuel produced natural gas in the grid operated by Kinder Morgan Trans Colorado. Calculations were performed ex-post, which makes me more confident.
