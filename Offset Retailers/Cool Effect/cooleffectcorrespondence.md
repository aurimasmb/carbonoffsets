>Dear Cool Effect Team,

>We are two recent grantees of the Fulbright program, a US government-sponsored academic exchange. We are exploring ways in which our 2016-2017 cohort can offset the emissions associated with our flight travel over this past year. We are currently reviewing carbon offset retailers. We wondered if you might be able to clarify a few points on your carbon offsetting program:

>1.	What is the vintage of the offsets we are purchasing? Can you confirm that all units which we are purchasing have already been issued? (We are concerned about “forward purchasing.”)
>2.	Is it possible to see the serial numbers of the units purchased on our behalf, and to receive notification of when these are retired so that we can see them on the relevant carbon registry?
>3.	On your website you mention that you conduct a financial and management analysis beyond the standard audits performed by VCS, Gold Standard, CDM, etc. and that you make these available to project supporters. We haven’t been able to find these documents on the project pages – are they located somewhere else that we haven’t found?

>Thanks very much for your help! Looking forward to being in touch.

>Best regards,
>Aurimas Bukauskas

>Thank you for reaching out and congratulations on your Fulbright Grant! (such a wonderful program)

>1. Cool Effect lists only the issued credits on our website. We guarantee that no offsets are sold before issuance. The vintages vary from 2012-2016 depending on the project, their cadence of issuance and credits available.

>2. Yes, although it depends on the project whether we can give you the exact numbers or which range of numbers your purchase was included in. For example, at the end of the month, we might retire 500 credits for a certain project and we get the range of 500 serial numbers. We could tell you that your purchase was in that range, but not which exact numbers your purchase corresponded to. Please note if you purchase the credits from the 'COLLECTION' then we will not be able to inform you the individual serial numbers. When we receive a simple dollar amount, it is allocated across all projects and results in fractional credits. 

>3. The financial and management analysis is conducted through our due diligence. This step is meant to crosscheck and update the information provided earlier (investment analysis,validation report etc.). This specific documents are not available on our website because of financial sensitivity issues, but we will be happy to check with specific projects whether this document can be shared with a supporter who is interested to purchase offsets from specific project/s. In most cases, the answer is yes. 

>Please let us know if you have further questions or would like to chat by phone.

>Hi,

>Thank you very much for your detailed answers!

>We're nearly finished putting together our guidance, and we just wanted to clarify a few final questions.

>In particular, I'd like to try to understand your process for carbon financing a bit better, and how our offset purchases fit in.

>Would you be available for a chat over the phone at all this week?

>(We are at GMT, so before 3 PM is best on our end.)

>Looking forward to being in touch further.

>Thanks,
Aurimas
