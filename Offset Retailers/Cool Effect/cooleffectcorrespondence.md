>Dear Cool Effect Team,

>We are two recent grantees of the Fulbright program, a US government-sponsored academic exchange. We are exploring ways in which our 2016-2017 cohort can offset the emissions associated with our flight travel over this past year. We are currently reviewing carbon offset retailers. We wondered if you might be able to clarify a few points on your carbon offsetting program:

>1.	What is the vintage of the offsets we are purchasing? Can you confirm that all units which we are purchasing have already been issued? (We are concerned about “forward purchasing.”)
>2.	Is it possible to see the serial numbers of the units purchased on our behalf, and to receive notification of when these are retired so that we can see them on the relevant carbon registry?
>3.	On your website you mention that you conduct a financial and management analysis beyond the standard audits performed by VCS, Gold Standard, CDM, etc. and that you make these available to project supporters. We haven’t been able to find these documents on the project pages – are they located somewhere else that we haven’t found?

>Thanks very much for your help! Looking forward to being in touch.

>Best regards,
>Aurimas Bukauskas
