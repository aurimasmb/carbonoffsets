# What's Cooking

_Notes on the "What's Cooking" Ugandan Cookstoves project on Cool Effect.org"_

## Oustanding Questions

1. Are these sorts of projects really additional.
2. Do these projects really produce the co-benefits they claim, and are there any unanticipated negative effects on local communities or ecologies?

### Specific Questions for "What's Cooking:"

1. How and how often do you monitor that stoves are actually being used?
2. Which biomass fuel savings test did you use?
3. What are the emissions factors associated with the baseline stoves being used? How are these calculated? Where is the data coming from?
4. How does the price of this project on Cool Effect compare to the price of stove project offsets in general?

## Answers / Notes Based on Reading Reports


From: http://externalassets.cooleffect.org/lib/content/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/15213553/Verification-Report_04042016.pdf

Stove usage rates are quite high, at least until 7-8 years old, when the rates drop signifantly.

Reactions from people were 100% positive? That seems cool, but could they just be telling the monitors what they want to hear?

Monitoring is a manual biennial review.

Reading the CAR's (Corrective Action Requests) is quite interesting as this shows how various issues and concerns with the project operation have been addressed. It seems that over the past two years these concerns have been well addressed. (Various things concerning how the counting is done, how the database is managed, etc.)

There are a lot of spelling errors though.

### Key Issues

#### Additionality:

Additionality calculation depends on being able to:

1. Accurately estimate biomass fuel reductions.

OK so one interesting point here is that you have to accurately calculate if / how much "non-renewable" biomass is being used for the stoves in the baseline scenario.

What does this mean and why exactly do we care?

Well if biomass is non-renewable, then by using it we are increasing carbon in the atmosphere?

What if it were actually renewable? Would that be much different? Well no... ?  Right, because we are still just emitting into the atmosphere?

Aren't we only just interested in the amount of total fuel emissions that have been reduced? Whether or not they come from renewable sources? 

Just because a source is "renewable" in that is being replaced, doesn't mean...

Oh wait - if we redesigned our cook stoves to use a hypothetically renewable source, as opposed to a hypotheticall non-renewable source, would that mean that we count that as a reduction?

For example: switching to a stove which used agricultural wastes? that would mean that although we are emitting the same amount of carbon, the carbon emitted by agricultural wastes would be a renewable resource because it would be coming from a source which continually replaces that sequestered carbon? As opposed to using trees, which would not normally have been cut.

Yeah you should reward this sort of behaviour right?

2. Accurately quantify the time that stoves are actually being used (both in comparison to existing stoves, and in general)

That was a concern with this CDM project for example: http://www.climatechangenews.com/2016/08/10/are-carbon-market-financed-cookstoves-really-clean/

#### Price

According to [this ](http://carbonfinanceforcookstoves.org/carbon-finance/prices-for-improved-cookstove-projects/) the price of cook stove project offsets are around $11 t/CO2e.

That means that the projects on Cool Effect are roughly within the range we expect, and the What's Cooking project is quite a bit cheaper actually.
