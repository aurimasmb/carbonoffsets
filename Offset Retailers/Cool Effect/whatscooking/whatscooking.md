# What's Cooking

_Notes on the "What's Cooking" Ugandan Cookstoves project on Cool Effect.org"_

## Oustanding Questions

1. Are these sorts of projects really additional.
2. Do these projects really produce the co-benefits they claim, and are there any unanticipated negative effects on local communities or ecologies?

### Specific Questions for "What's Cooking:"

1. How and how often do you monitor that stoves are actually being used?
2. Which biomass fuel savings test did you use?

### Key Issues

#### Additionality:

Additionality calculation depends on being able to:

1. Accurately estimate biomass fuel reductions.

OK so one interesting point here is that you have to accurately calculate if / how much "non-renewable" biomass is being used for the stoves in the baseline scenario.

What does this mean and why exactly do we care?

Well if biomass is non-renewable.





2. Accurately quantify the time that stoves are actually being used (both in comparison to existing stoves, and in general)
