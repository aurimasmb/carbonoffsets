[Kolvidur](http://kolvidur.is/carbon-calculator/) - Icelandic government initiative to plant birch and spruce forests in Iceland. Very poor English - honestly not sure how / if this program is working anymore and if it accepts payments from individuals any more...

[World Land Trust](http://www.worldlandtrust.org/eco-services/carbon-balanced) - This source from the UK offers projects, but does not give much detail on them or clearly quantify the offsets from each.

[carbonfund](http://carbonfund.org/individuals) - source from the US

[Sustainable Travel International](http://sustainabletravel.org/utilities/carbon-calculator/) 

[Atmosfair](https://www.atmosfair.de/en/home/) - German provider. Uses Clean Development Mechanism "Gold Standard?". No annual reports since 2014???

[United Airlines](http://co2offsets.sustainabletravelinternational.org/ua/offsets) - United will calculate your carbon footprint and suggested monetary offset based off routes. Its route selection is a bit limited, but you can find comparable routes to your own to get a rough estimate. It offers two offset projects, a wind farm in Texas and a reforestation project in Peru through a partner, Sustainable Travel International. Both projects are under the [Verified Carbon Standard](http://www.v-c-s.org/project/vcs-program/).
