>Dear Carbon Footprint offsets team,

>We are two recent grantees of the Fulbright programme, a US government-sponsored academic exchange. We are exploring ways in which our  2016-2017 cohort can offset the emissions associated with our flight travel over this past year. We are currently reviewing Carbon Offset retailers. We wondered if you might be able to clarify a few points on your carbon offsetting program:

>1.	When are the offset which we purchase retired? Are they retired immediately, or in bulk at some later time? 
>2.	Is it possible to see the serial numbers of the offsets purchased on our behalf, and to receive notification of when these are retired so that we can see them on the Markit registry?

>Thanks very much,
Aurimas Bukauskas

>Hi Aurimas,

>Many thanks for your email about carbon offsetting.

>If you have a need for your carbon offset credits to be retired straight away we can do that. We typically group the retirements together at several points in the year, but are happy to retire your credits specifically for you following receipt of payment. 

>All the credits are retired publicly on the registries. For voluntary offsets we have accounts with Markit and APX â€“ both have publicly viewable sections. We can provide you a link to show your retired credits and put a comment to say they are retired on your behalf if you like. You will also be able to see the serial numbers.

>Do you know how much you need to offset and which project(s) you would prefer to contribute too?

>Many thanks,
John
