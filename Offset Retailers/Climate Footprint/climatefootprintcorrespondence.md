>Dear Carbon Footprint offsets team,

>We are two recent grantees of the Fulbright programme, a US government-sponsored academic exchange. We are exploring ways in which our  2016-2017 cohort can offset the emissions associated with our flight travel over this past year. We are currently reviewing Carbon Offset retailers. We wondered if you might be able to clarify a few points on your carbon offsetting program:

>1.	When are the offset which we purchase retired? Are they retired immediately, or in bulk at some later time? 
2.	Is it possible to see the serial numbers of the offsets purchased on our behalf, and to receive notification of when these are retired so that we can see them on the Markit registry?

>Thanks very much,
Aurimas Bukauskas
