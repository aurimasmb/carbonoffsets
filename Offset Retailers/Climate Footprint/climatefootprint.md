* **YESIL Hydro Power Plant.**

YESIL Issurance History: http://www.vcsprojectdatabase.org/#/vcus/p_806

There appear to be only a very small number of VCU's available with YESIL: http://www.vcsprojectdatabase.org/index-no-tabs.html#/vcu_details_report/87815 (only 128 in that batch!)

All others already retired - the latest batch was retired in 2016 11 17.

Retirement batches are all quite small < 150 , except for one which is very large at 33,800. 

Are the small ones all Climate Footprint?

Also, all of the VCU's are from a vintage in 2009-2012. Interesting to know when Climate Footprint purchased these?
