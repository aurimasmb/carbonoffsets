# BP Target Neutral

https://www.bptargetneutral.com/uk/calculate/tonnes/

Every project which BP Target Neutral purchases offsets from comply with either the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), Gold Standard, or the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).

BP provides a convenient carbon calculator which allows for multiple flight legs to be added conveniently.

BP retires its carbon offsets in bulk. 

BP on providing an audit trail:

>Hi, we’ve spoken to the retirement team and this is something we would struggle to provide in terms of an audit trail. All offsets going through our online carbon calculator are grouped together and retired in bulk which means we wouldn’t be able to separate your flights in the registry and make a connection with a specific offset project. We do provide a full audit service for large volumes based on an invoice transaction ie. not via the online credit card calculator but this is usually for offset programmes around 4000+ tCO2e per year. If you are in that volume area then let us know.

## Questions

1. Could we see the serial numbers of the VCU's or VER's that we are purchasing?
  * Or, more specifically, is there a way that we can see our VCU's or VER's being retired on the APX or Markit registries for example?
2. Which projects specifically are our funds being used for?
  * Is there a way to choose specifically which projects are funds are used for?
