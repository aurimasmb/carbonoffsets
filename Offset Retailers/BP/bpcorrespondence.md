>Dear BP Target Neutral,

>We are a group of students and academics who have recently completed a year of study and research in the UK supported by the Fulbright Program. Over the course of our Fulbright year, we have done a lot of international travel, mostly by plane. We are interested in exploring opportunities to offset our emissions from flying, and are currently researching carbon offset retailers. 

>We are interested in purchasing offsets through BP Target Neutral, however we have a few questions concerning the offsets offered. In particular, we're interested in the following:

>1. Is it possible to see the the serial / registration numbers of the VCU's / VER's we are retiring with our purchase?
>2. Is it possible to verify in some way, for example, by viewing the APX or Markit registries, that these VCU's / VER's have in fact been retired?
>3. Is it possible to know which specific projects our funds are being directed to?
>4. Is it possible to choose which projects our funds will be directed to?

>We look forward to your reply, and hope to be in touch again soon.

>Thank you, 
Aurimas Bukauskas & Michael Donatti  
Fulbright Postgraduate Scholars, 2017

>Hi, we’ve spoken to the retirement team and this is something we would struggle to provide in terms of an audit trail. All offsets going through our online carbon calculator are grouped together and retired in bulk which means we wouldn’t be able to separate your flights in the registry and make a connection with a specific offset project. We do provide a full audit service for large volumes based on an invoice transaction ie. not via the online credit card calculator but this is usually for offset programmes around 4000+ tCO2e per year. If you are in that volume area then let us know.

>Best regards
