## Questions

1. Could we see the serial numbers of the VCU's or VER's that we are purchasing?
  * Or, more specifically, is there a way that we can see our VCU's or VER's being retired on the APX or Markit registries for example?
2. Which projects specifically are our funds being used for?
  * Is there a way to choose specifically which projects are funds are used for?
