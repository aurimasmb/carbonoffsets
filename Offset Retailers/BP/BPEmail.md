# Draft Email to BP Target Neutral


## Questions

1. Could we see the serial numbers of the VCU's or VER's that we are purchasing?
  * Or, more specifically, is there a way that we can see our VCU's or VER's being retired on the APX or Markit registries for example?

Dear BP Target Neutral,

We are a group of students and academics who have recently completed a year of study and research in the UK supported by the Fulbright Program. Over the course of our Fulbright year, we have done a lot of international travel, mostly by plane. We are interested in exploring opportunities to offset our emissions from flying, and are currently researching carbon offset retailers. 

We are interested in purchasing offsets through BP Target Neutral, however we have a few questions concerning the offsets offered. In particular, we're interested in the following:

1. Is it possible to see the the serial / registration numbers of the VCU's / VER's we are retiring with our purchase?
2. Is it possible to verify in some way, for example, by viewing the APX or Markit registries, that these VCU's / VER's have in fact been retired?
3. Is it possible to know which specific projects our funds are being directed to?
4. Is it possible to choose which projects our funds will be directed to?

We look forward to your reply, and hope to be in touch again soon.

Thank you,
