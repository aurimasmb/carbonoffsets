>Hello,

>I wanted to confirm that the carbon offsets I purchased were for the Capricorn Wind Farm project, as detailed by United.

>Also, I am curious as to the process. Does Sustainable Travel International have pre-purchased VCUs that it retires when someone like me pays for offsets? Or does it not purchase any VCUs beforehand? Are the VCUs purchased directly from the project's provider?

>Thank you!

>Kind regards,
>Michael Donatti
