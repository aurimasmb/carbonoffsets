# Crowdfunding

Thoughts on crowdfunding in general:

One concern with crowdfunding is that individuals who are investing do not necessarily have the time, resources, or skills to perform the necessary due diligence on the purchases / investments they are making.

Large corporations and government purchasers have the resources to due thorough due diligence.
