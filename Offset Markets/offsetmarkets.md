# Offset Markets

**Voluntary offset markets** are _retail_ markets, meaning that the offset credits/units being sold each have unique qualities and the consumers of these offsets are looking for different qualities in the offsets they purchase. 

This is in contrast to **compliance-based offset markets**, where offset credits/units are essentially _commodities_ (like gold or milk) - meaning that they are interchangeable, and that consumers are looking only to obtain a certain quantity of them.

From the [State of Voluntary Offsets Market Report 2015](http://forest-trends.org/releases/uploads/SOVCM2015_FullReport.pdf):

>The voluntary offset market behaves more like a retail product market than a traditional commodity marketplace:
buyers back projects based on their unique characteristics such as project location, type, and standard â€“ which in
turn affects price.

## Verified Carbon Standard Verified Carbon Units Market

VCS verifies the quality of carbon offset projects. These can be found in the [VCS Project Database.](http://www.vcsprojectdatabase.org/)

VCU's (Verified Carbon Units) represent 1 tonne of emissions. VCU's are created when a VCS-verified project registers them (and one of VCS's 3rd party Validating / Verifying Bodies (VVB's) validates and verifies them. They are then tracked on the APX and Markit registries, where they are sold, and eventually retired.

_Note: It is not recommended to buy VCU's with the intent to resell if you are individual investor. See [1](http://www.redd-monitor.org/2013/05/20/why-doesnt-vcs-warn-against-buying-carbon-credits-as-an-investment/)_ 

_Our best bet might be to approach one of these environmental consultancies to see if they would be willing to work with Fulbright / DCarb._

### Retailers:

* Trees For Life is selling VCU's registered on Markit for AUD 12 / tonne. - https://www.treesforlife.org.au/shop/item/1-verified-carbon-units
* First Carbon Credits Corporation sells credits under FCCC? which apparently follows VCS, Gold Standard, or CDM. claim to provide registration numbers but still a bit sketch. Also selling at CAD 15 ~=  USD 11.50, which is a tad high. http://shop.firstcarboncredits.com/category-s/1822.htm
* CarbonNeutral.au is selling VCU's in bulk to businesses. Could we contact them to see if they would sell to us as individuals? https://carbonneutral.com.au/verified-carbon-units/
* ICROA List of Carbon Retailer Members - http://icroa.org/Our-Members - These are all environmental consultancies.
  * www.bptargetneutral.com/uk/calculate/ - Seems like a legit calculator, because has methodology statement with citations.

#### QAS 

In the UK, retailers may be accredited with the Quality Assurance Standard for carbon which places certain quality requirements on carbon offset retailers.

There is a very interesting document which discusses the state of the voluntary carbon offset market here:

http://forest-trends.org/releases/uploads/SOVCM2015_FullReport.pdf

Here is a followup document which is even more interesting:

http://forest-trends.org/releases/uploads/SOVCM%20Webinar%20Q&A%20Document%20June%2025%202015.pdf

Basically, as far as I understand:

The Verified Carbon Standard allows projects to register Verified Carbon Units, which each represent one ton of emissions reductions that has been validated and verified according to VCS rules. These units can then be purchased by individuals, corporations or governments which want to offset their emissions. Interestingly, these units can also be sold on to other entities. This is a voluntary market, so the demand for VCU's is purely based on entities wanting to buy the right to say that they have offset their emissions.

Question: 

1. **Are VCU's linked at all times to the project from which they were purchased?**

Answer:

From [above document](http://forest-trends.org/releases/uploads/SOVCM%20Webinar%20Q&A%20Document%20June%2025%202015.pdf):  

>Each project type, and even projects within the same sector, can command very different
prices, and it is up to the developer to do their due diligence before diving in and then
make the case that their particular project delivers compelling benefits, which can
translate into good pricing. We do see new projects entering the system all the time, and
that must be because these developers know there are compelling stories behind them
that can command decent prices.

Ok, so each project is selling VCU's at some individual price based on its costs to deliver that project, and the degree of risk associated with that offset remaining permanent.

2. If a project ultimately fails, or some carbon is re-emitted in the course of that project, say, for example, through a forest fire, does that then mean that those VCU's are destroyed? Would the end buyer of those VCU's then be notified and decide to buy more to offset their carbon?


3. As an individual seeking to offset my carbon in a rigorous way, is there a browseable database of VCS projects from which I can buy VCU's from?


So for example, you could build a nice website which gives users access to
