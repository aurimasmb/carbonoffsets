# Offset Markets

**Voluntary offset markets** are _retail_ markets, meaning that the offset credits/units being sold each have unique qualities and the consumers of these offsets are looking for different qualities in the offsets they purchase. 

This is in contrast to **compliance-based offset markets**, where offset credits/units are essentially _commodities_ (like gold or milk) - meaning that they are interchangeable, and that consumers are looking only to obtain a certain quantity of them.

From the [State of Voluntary Offsets Market Report 2015](http://forest-trends.org/releases/uploads/SOVCM2015_FullReport.pdf):

>The voluntary offset market behaves more like a retail product market than a traditional commodity marketplace:
buyers back projects based on their unique characteristics such as project location, type, and standard â€“ which in
turn affects price.


## Verified Carbon Standard Verified Carbon Units Market

VCS verifies the quality of carbon offset projects. These can be found in the [VCS Project Database.](http://www.vcsprojectdatabase.org/)

VCU's (Verified Carbon Units) represent 1 tonne of emissions. VCU's are created when a VCS-verified project registers them (and one of VCS's 3rd party Validating / Verifying Bodies (VVB's) validates and verifies them. They are then tracked on the APX and Markit registries, where they are sold, and eventually retired.

_Note: It is not recommended to buy VCU's with the intent to resell if you are individual investor. See [1](http://www.redd-monitor.org/2013/05/20/why-doesnt-vcs-warn-against-buying-carbon-credits-as-an-investment/)_
