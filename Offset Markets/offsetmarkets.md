# Offset Markets

**Voluntary offset markets** are _retail_ markets, meaning that the offset credits/units being sold each have unique qualities and the consumers of these offsets are looking for different qualities in the offsets they purchase. 

This is in contrast to **compliance-based offset markets**, where offset credits/units are essentially _commodities_ (like gold or milk) - meaning that they are interchangeable, and that consumers are looking only to obtain a certain quantity of them.

From the [State of Voluntary Offsets Market Report 2015](http://forest-trends.org/releases/uploads/SOVCM2015_FullReport.pdf):

>The voluntary offset market behaves more like a retail product market than a traditional commodity marketplace:
buyers back projects based on their unique characteristics such as project location, type, and standard â€“ which in
turn affects price.
