# Offset Markets

From the [State of Voluntary Offsets Market Report 2015](http://forest-trends.org/releases/uploads/SOVCM2015_FullReport.pdf):

>The voluntary offset market behaves more like a retail product market than a traditional commodity marketplace:
buyers back projects based on their unique characteristics such as project location, type, and standard â€“ which in
turn affects price.
