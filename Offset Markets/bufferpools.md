# Buffer Pools

_Notes on Buffer Pools for land-use carbon offset projects._

## Summary

Buffer pools are a VCS tool to insure offset purchases in AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use) projects. From our understanding, projects give some of their generated credits to the buffer pool. Anytime a project loses generated credits because of some unforeseen disaster (fire, hurricane, pest, etc.), the pool cancels an equivalent number of credits. The pool sometimes returns credits to projects that are doing well so they can get more revenue on the carbon market. This incentivises good management.
To give an example:
A, B, and C each generate 100 credits from afforestation, giving 20 to the buffer pool and selling 80 on the carbon market.
C experiences a forest fire, decimating the equivalent of 40 credits it already sold on the carbon market. The pool cancels 40 credits to compensate.
B shows particularly good forest management practises, so it receives an extra 5 credits from the pool to sell on the market for revenue.

>The pooled buffer account is a reserve of nontradable
credits that serves as a shared insurance
pool for all VCS AFOLU projects. If carbon stocks
are lost in an individual project as a result of
unforeseen events such as fire, disease or
encroachment by outside actors, buffer credits may
be cancelled from the buffer account to
compensate for the loss.

>Credits from the buffer pool may be released back
over time to projects where risks have been
successfully mitigated, incentivizing better
management practices. The buffer approach serves
as a form of insurance for all AFOLU credits,
ensuring that issued credits remain permanent and
that VCUs from AFOLU projects are fungible with
VCUs from all other project types.
