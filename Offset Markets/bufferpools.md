>The pooled buffer account is a reserve of nontradable
credits that serves as a shared insurance
pool for all VCS AFOLU projects. If carbon stocks
are lost in an individual project as a result of
unforeseen events such as fire, disease or
encroachment by outside actors, buffer credits may
be cancelled from the buffer account to
compensate for the loss.

>Credits from the buffer pool may be released back
over time to projects where risks have been
successfully mitigated, incentivizing better
management practices. The buffer approach serves
as a form of insurance for all AFOLU credits,
ensuring that issued credits remain permanent and
that VCUs from AFOLU projects are fungible with
VCUs from all other project types.
