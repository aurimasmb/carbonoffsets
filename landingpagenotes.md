Welcome to the Carbon Offsets wiki! 

This is a guide for those interested in offsetting their personal carbon emissions from flying (or anything, really). We created this guide because the information available online for individuals looking to offset their personal emissions is often not clearly presented, out of date, or not impartial.

## TL;DR:

1. Calculate your CO2 emissions in tonnes using the BP Target Neutral online calculator.
2. Purchase carbon offsets from one or more projects listed on Cool Effect.org.
3. Tell us how much you offset and which projects you chose!

Let's see how much of our collective carbon footprint we can offset!

## The Long Version

Voluntary carbon offsetting is still a relatively new and the market is not very transparent or well regulated. We wanted to answer some of our own questions and concerns about carbon offsetting before recommending that anyone purchase offsets. This wiki is a collection of what we've learned.

**Our key conclusions:**

1. There are established **standards** (VCS, Gold Standard, and CDM) which are doing an increasingly good job at enforcing quality requirements on carbon offsetting projects and retailers. 
2. The carbon offset market is still not very convenient or transparent for _individuals_ seeking to offset their carbon emissions (businesses are better catered for). Individuals need to do their own **due diligence** to make sure that they are purchasing high-quality offsets at a reasonable price.
3. Carbon offsets are **cheap!** At an average of ___ per tonne, it would cost the average US citizen only .... to offset their entire year's carbon emissions.

**Our recommendation:** We _do_ think that carbon offsets are an effective way to reduce your personal contribution to climate change, as long as you are critical and careful about where you purchase your offsets from. 

Of course, offsetting should only be _a part of your plan_ to reduce your impact. In many cases the most effective reductions come from lifestyle choices which directly reduce your emissions.
