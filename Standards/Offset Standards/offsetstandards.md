# Offset Standards

_Notes on Carbon Offsets Standards._


Many third party standards exist to certify that carbon offset options are legitimate. These [standards](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/consumer/Standards.html) have different managing agencies and differing requirements, but most seem quite good. 

[A WWF report comparing offsetting standards](http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/global/pdf/WWF_2008_A%20comparison%20of%20C%20offset%20Standards.pdf) - this report is far longer than any of us will read, but the 12th page of the pdf compares the standards along some important metrics. 

### Verified Carbon Standard - Do we need these links here? The "standards" link above can connect them to any of these websites.

...

South Africa is considering draft legislation on Carbon Taxation / Offsetting that would recognise Verified Carbon Standard projects as a legal way to offset carbon. Does this mean it is sufficiently legit?

VCS uses 3rd-party Validation/Verification bodies to perform quality checks on the projects accredited by the program. http://database.v-c-s.org/verification-validation/what-vvb. There are currently about 30 active VVB's, and they are worldwide.

**Verified Carbon Units (VCU's)** These represent units of offset carbon. These are monitored in two central registries. 

Something about individual investors not buying carbon credits? http://www.icroa.org/resources/Pictures/IETA-ICROA-CMIA%20-%20statement%20re%20investment%20in%20carbon%20credits%20-%20140531.pdf - What if I am buying them just as a permanent offset??? Don't quite fully understand this market...

### Voluntary Gold Standard

## Other Standards

These are some other standards we haven't really looked at yet:

* American Carbon Registry : http://americancarbonregistry.org/how-it-works/what-we-do - Only used for Californian projects.
