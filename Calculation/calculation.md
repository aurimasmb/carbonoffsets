_Notes on how to calculate your emissions._



Many websites exist to help you calculate your carbon footprint, which you can then partially or fully offset.

[CarbonBalanced.Org](http://www.carbonbalanced.org/calculator/flights.asp)

[climatecare.org](http://www.http://climatecare.org/calculator/)

[myclimate](http://www.http://co2.myclimate.org/en/flight_calculators/new), which calculates emissions from a given flight trajectory.

## Aviation Emissions

This section should include information about how aviation emissions specifically contribute to climate change. [i.e. radiative forcing at high altitude... etc...](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/aviation/RFI.html)

[Radiative Forcing](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/aviation/RF.html)

a measure used to understand how non-CO2 greenhouse gases affect climate change and how they are integrated into our emissions calculation, and [Radiative Forcing Index](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/aviation/RFI.html).
