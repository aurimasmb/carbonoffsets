### Todo List (19 July 2017) - a few more hours work.

1. ~~Email United again to check about their prices and retirement scheme.~~
2. Prepare simple Wiki for Fulbrighters interested in learning more about offsetting:
  * Finish Standards Page -- Auri
  * Evaluate more retailers:
    * ClimateNeutralNow (CDM) -- Auri
    * CarbonFootprint.com (VCS, Gold Standard, CDM?) -- Michael
    * Any others?
  * Finish Home Page FAQ's -- Both
  * Finish Policy page: 
    * Brief summary of ETS / CORSIA. -- Auri
  * Organise more detailed / in-depth Notes page. -- Michael
3. Draft Email to Fulbrighters, directing them to BP Target Neutral?

**Key questions that we as Fulbrighters may have:**

1. Are carbon offsets even a good idea?

2. If so, which ones should we buy?


## Introduction

Most of what we do emits greenhouse gas emissions (A.K.A. carbon emissions) in some form: carbon dioxide, methane, or even water vapor. A carbon offset is a way to diminish carbon emissions elsewhere even as we increase them through our activities. As Fulbrighters, one of our biggest sources of emissions is flying. To offset these emissions, we calculate our emissions (see "Calculating carbon emissions"), then pay a corresponding amount to a carbon offset provider (see "Carbon Offset Providers"). Most of these providers either create a carbon sink by planting trees or diminish future emissions by developing renewable energy. The latter projects often bring about social benefits by providing clean development and jobs in the host community. Just below are some sources describing carbon offsets (and some potential controversies around them).


[Carbon Offset Research & Education (CORE)](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/index.html) offers thorough information about carbon offsetting (but note that it was last updated in 2011!).

[CORE - Are Carbon offsets a scam?](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/consumer/GoodorBad.html) - Great article addressing key arguments for and against offsetting.

[IATA](http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/environment/Documents/carbon-offset-guidelines-may2008.pdf) offers another guide all about carbon offsetting, specifically from an aviation angle.

["On the flight path to global meltdown" in The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/sep/21/travelsenvironmentalimpact.ethicalliving) - This article by George Monbiot offers a more extreme argument: that we must halt our air travel pretty much altogether.


### Effects of Aviation Emissions

This section should include information about how aviation emissions specifically contribute to climate change. [i.e. radiative forcing at high altitude... etc...](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/aviation/RFI.html)

http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/aviation/ClimateImpacts.html

### Policy

The EU has included commercial aviation as part of its [Emissions Trading System](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets_en), a Cap-and-Trade system, [since 2008 (or 2012??)](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets_en). Recently, the rules were changed so that the ETS cap and trade system only applied to flights within the EEA. This is to allow for a global aviation emissions limitation program called [CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation)](https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Pages/market-based-measures.aspx). CORSIA is an offsets program which requires airlines in countries in participating countries to purchase carbon offsets for any emissions increases after 2020. Participation by countries is on a voluntary basis, [and will start in 2021.](http://atwonline.com/regulatory-data/corsia-timeline)

[WWF's criticism of CORSIA, and argument to stop new runway construction at Heathrow.](https://www.wwf.org.uk/sites/default/files/2017-05/WWF_Grounded_report_FINAL_1.pdf)

_**Auri's opinion:** This legislation seems super weak. **Offsetting** the **growth** of emissions after **2020**?? That's a pretty lame goal. Does this mean that we as citizens should try to do more to reduce/offset our personal impact, because clearly the legislation is not going to do much, and certainly won't do much for a while?_


## Important Terms

[Additionality](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/consumer/Additionality.html) - would carbon emissions have occurred without the program's involvement? This question is important, because if the answer is no then we are not really offsetting our emissions at all by contributing to a program.

[Radiative Forcing](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/aviation/RF.html), a measure used to understand how non-CO2 greenhouse gases affect climate change and how they are integrated into our emissions calculation, and [Radiative Forcing Index](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/aviation/RFI.html).

## Standards

Many third party standards exist to certify that carbon offset options are legitimate. These [standards](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/consumer/Standards.html) have different managing agencies and differing requirements, but most seem quite good. 

[A WWF report comparing offsetting standards](http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/global/pdf/WWF_2008_A%20comparison%20of%20C%20offset%20Standards.pdf) - this report is far longer than any of us will read, but the 12th page of the pdf compares the standards along some important metrics. 

### Verified Carbon Standard - Do we need these links here? The "standards" link above can connect them to any of these websites.

...

South Africa is considering draft legislation on Carbon Taxation / Offsetting that would recognise Verified Carbon Standard projects as a legal way to offset carbon. Does this mean it is sufficiently legit?

VCS uses 3rd-party Validation/Verification bodies to perform quality checks on the projects accredited by the program. http://database.v-c-s.org/verification-validation/what-vvb. There are currently about 30 active VVB's, and they are worldwide.

[VCS Project Database:](http://www.vcsprojectdatabase.org/#/home)

[List of VCS program documents](http://database.v-c-s.org/program-documents)

**Verified Carbon Units (VCU's)** These represent units of offset carbon. These are monitored in two central registries. 

Something about individual investors not buying carbon credits? http://www.icroa.org/resources/Pictures/IETA-ICROA-CMIA%20-%20statement%20re%20investment%20in%20carbon%20credits%20-%20140531.pdf - What if I am buying them just as a permanent offset??? Don't quite fully understand this market...

## Calculating carbon emissions

Many websites exist to help you calculate your carbon footprint, which you can then partially or fully offset.

[CarbonBalanced.Org](http://www.carbonbalanced.org/calculator/flights.asp)

[climatecare.org](http://www.http://climatecare.org/calculator/)

[myclimate](http://www.http://co2.myclimate.org/en/flight_calculators/new), which calculates emissions from a given flight trajectory.


## How to offset carbon?

Once you know you want to offset some of your emissions, many providers exist for you to donate to carbon offset projects.

The following links list some and rate them along various metrics.

[CORE: What makes a good carbon offset program?](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/consumer/OffsetQuality.html)

[CORE List of Studies Which Rate Carbon Offset Providers](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/consumer/OffsetRatings.html)

[QAS List of Carbon Offset Providers](https://qascarbonneutral.com/best-carbon-offsets/)

### Some carbon offset providers we know of:

[Kolvidur](http://kolvidur.is/carbon-calculator/) - Icelandic government initiative to plant birch and spruce forests in Iceland. Very poor English - honestly not sure how / if this program is working anymore and if it accepts payments from individuals any more...

[World Land Trust](http://www.worldlandtrust.org/eco-services/carbon-balanced) - This source from the UK offers projects, but does not give much detail on them or clearly quantify the offsets from each.

[carbonfund](http://carbonfund.org/individuals) - source from the US

[Sustainable Travel International](http://sustainabletravel.org/utilities/carbon-calculator/) 

[Atmosfair](https://www.atmosfair.de/en/home/) - German provider. Uses Clean Development Mechanism "Gold Standard?". No annual reports since 2014???

[United Airlines](http://co2offsets.sustainabletravelinternational.org/ua/offsets) - United will calculate your carbon footprint and suggested monetary offset based off routes. Its route selection is a bit limited, but you can find comparable routes to your own to get a rough estimate. It offers two offset projects, a wind farm in Texas and a reforestation project in Peru through a partner, Sustainable Travel International. Both projects are under the [Verified Carbon Standard](http://www.v-c-s.org/project/vcs-program/).

### Some notes on Carbon Markets

There is a very interesting document which discusses the state of the voluntary carbon offset market here:

http://forest-trends.org/releases/uploads/SOVCM2015_FullReport.pdf

Here is a followup document which is even more interesting:

http://forest-trends.org/releases/uploads/SOVCM%20Webinar%20Q&A%20Document%20June%2025%202015.pdf

Basically, as far as I understand:

The Verified Carbon Standard allows projects to register Verified Carbon Units, which each represent one ton of emissions reductions that has been validated and verified according to VCS rules. These units can then be purchased by individuals, corporations or governments which want to offset their emissions. Interestingly, these units can also be sold on to other entities. This is a voluntary market, so the demand for VCU's is purely based on entities wanting to buy the right to say that they have offset their emissions.

Question: 

1. **Are VCU's linked at all times to the project from which they were purchased?**

Answer:

From [above document](http://forest-trends.org/releases/uploads/SOVCM%20Webinar%20Q&A%20Document%20June%2025%202015.pdf):  

>Each project type, and even projects within the same sector, can command very different
prices, and it is up to the developer to do their due diligence before diving in and then
make the case that their particular project delivers compelling benefits, which can
translate into good pricing. We do see new projects entering the system all the time, and
that must be because these developers know there are compelling stories behind them
that can command decent prices.

Ok, so each project is selling VCU's at some individual price based on its costs to deliver that project, and the degree of risk associated with that offset remaining permanent.

2. If a project ultimately fails, or some carbon is re-emitted in the course of that project, say, for example, through a forest fire, does that then mean that those VCU's are destroyed? Would the end buyer of those VCU's then be notified and decide to buy more to offset their carbon?


3. As an individual seeking to offset my carbon in a rigorous way, is there a browseable database of VCS projects from which I can buy VCU's from?


So for example, you could build a nice website which gives users access to
