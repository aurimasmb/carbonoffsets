# carbonoffsets

Welcome to the Carbon Offsets Wiki **research notes section**! _Did you mean to visit the **[Wiki](https://github.com/aurimasmb/carbonoffsets/wiki)**?_

This is a guide for those interested in offsetting their personal carbon emissions from flying (or anything, really). We created this guide because the information available online for individuals looking to offset their personal emissions is often not clearly presented, out of date, or not impartial. This section contains our unsorted notes and documents collected during the course of our research.
