How to offset your carbon emissions.

Key Questions Fulbrighters Will Have:

1. Are carbon offsets even a good idea?

2. If so, which ones should I buy?


## Introduction

[CORE - Are Carbon offsets a scam?](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/consumer/GoodorBad.html) - Great article addressing key arguments for and against offsetting.

[CORE Guide](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/index.html) - Nice, thorough and pretty academic-looking introduction to carbon offsetting. Seems to have been last updated in 2011 though!

IATA Guide to Carbon Offsets: http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/environment/Documents/carbon-offset-guidelines-may2008.pdf

## Important Terms

[Additionality](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/consumer/Additionality.html) - would carbon emmissions have occurred without the program's involvement?

## How to offset carbon?

_Question: which are the most reputable, most succesful carbon offset providers?_

[CORE: What makes a good carbon offset program?](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/consumer/OffsetQuality.html)

[CORE List of Studies Which Rate Carbon Offset Providers](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/consumer/OffsetRatings.html)

[QAS List of Carbon Offset Providers](https://qascarbonneutral.com/best-carbon-offsets/)

[Kolvidur](http://kolvidur.is/carbon-calculator/) - Icelandic government initiative to plant birch and spruce forests in Iceland. Very poor English - honestly not sure how / if this program is working anymore and if it accepts payments from individuals any more...



[World Land Trust](http://www.worldlandtrust.org/eco-services/carbon-balanced) - Hmm... not much detail on the projects?

## Carbon Offset Providers

[Atmosfair](https://www.atmosfair.de/en/home/) - German provider. Uses Clean Development Mechanism "Gold Standard?". No annual reports since 2014???

[United Airlines](http://co2offsets.sustainabletravelinternational.org/ua/offsets) - United will calculate your carbon footprint and suggested monetary offset based off routes. Its route selection is a bit limited, but you can find comparable routes to your own to get a rough estimate. It offers two offset projects, a wind farm in Texas and a reforestation project in Peru through a partner, Sustainable Travel International. Both projects are under the [Verified Carbon Standard](http://www.v-c-s.org/project/vcs-program/)
