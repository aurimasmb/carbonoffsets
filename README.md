## How to offset carbon?

[Kolvidur](http://kolvidur.is/carbon-calculator/) - Icelandic government initiative to plant birch and spruce forests in Iceland. Very poor English - honestly not sure how / if this program is working anymore and if it accepts payments from individuals any more...

[Atmosfair](https://www.atmosfair.de/en/home/) - German program. Looks legit.
