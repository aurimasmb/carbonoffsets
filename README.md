# carbonoffsets

We created this guide to hopefully inspire you to offset the emissions of some of the traveling you've done during your Fulbright year. It contains information on carbon offsetting, some background on standards, some articles about the debate surrounding offsetting, and some offset providers that we recommend. It is by no means comprehensive, so we recommend you do your own research if you're intersted! And remember, the best thing we can do is reduce our own emissions (minimise flying and driving, eat more local food, and so on). But acknowledging that minimising our emissions to zero is not yet possible or preferable, carbon offsetting can help create some good to counteract the bad :)

How to offset your carbon emissions.

**Key questions that we as Fulbrighters may have:**

1. Are carbon offsets even a good idea?

2. If so, which ones should we buy?


## Introduction

Most of what we do emits greenhouse gas emissions (A.K.A. carbon emissions) in some form: carbon dioxide, methane, or even water vapor. A carbon offset is a way to diminish carbon emissions elsewhere even as we increase them through our activities. As Fulbrighters, one of our biggest sources of emissions is flying. To offset these emissions, we calculate our emissions (see "Calculating carbon emissions"), then pay a corresponding amount to a carbon offset provider (see "Carbon Offset Providers"). Most of these providers either create a carbon sink by planting trees or diminish future emissions by developing renewable energy. The latter projects often bring about social benefits by providing clean development and jobs in the host community. Just below are some sources describing carbon offsets (and some potential controversies around them).


[Carbon Offset Research & Education (CORE)](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/index.html) offers thorough information about carbon offsetting (but note that it was last updated in 2011!).

[CORE - Are Carbon offsets a scam?](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/consumer/GoodorBad.html) - Great article addressing key arguments for and against offsetting.

[IATA](http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/environment/Documents/carbon-offset-guidelines-may2008.pdf) offers another guide all about carbon offsetting, specifically from an aviation angle.

["On the flight path to global meltdown" in The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/sep/21/travelsenvironmentalimpact.ethicalliving) - This article by George Monbiot offers a more extreme argument: that we must halt our air travel pretty much altogether.


### Effects of Aviation Emissions

asdfasdfasdf

### Policy

The EU has included commercial aviation as part of its [Emissions Trading System](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets_en), a Cap-and-Trade system, [since 2008 (or 2012??)](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets_en). Recently, the rules were changed so that the ETS cap and trade system only applied to flights within the EEA. This is to allow for a global aviation emissions limitation program called [CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation)](https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Pages/market-based-measures.aspx). CORSIA is an offsets program which requires airlines in countries in participating countries to purchase carbon offsets for any emissions increases after 2020. Participation by countries is on a voluntary basis.

_**Auri's opinion:** This legislation seems super weak. **Offsetting** the **growth** of emissions after **2020**?? That's a pretty 


## Important Terms

[Additionality](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/consumer/Additionality.html) - would carbon emissions have occurred without the program's involvement?

[Radiative Forcing](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/aviation/RF.html), a measure used to understand how non-CO2 greenhouse gases affect climate change and how they are integrated into our emissions calculation, and [Radiative Forcing Index](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/aviation/RFI.html).

## Standards

[A WWF report comparing offsetting standards](http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/global/pdf/WWF_2008_A%20comparison%20of%20C%20offset%20Standards.pdf) - this report is far longer than any of us will read, but the 12th page of the pdf compares the standards along some important metrics.

## How to offset carbon?

_Question: which are the most reputable, most succesful carbon offset providers?_

[CORE: What makes a good carbon offset program?](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/consumer/OffsetQuality.html)

[CORE List of Studies Which Rate Carbon Offset Providers](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/consumer/OffsetRatings.html)

[QAS List of Carbon Offset Providers](https://qascarbonneutral.com/best-carbon-offsets/)

[Kolvidur](http://kolvidur.is/carbon-calculator/) - Icelandic government initiative to plant birch and spruce forests in Iceland. Very poor English - honestly not sure how / if this program is working anymore and if it accepts payments from individuals any more...



[World Land Trust](http://www.worldlandtrust.org/eco-services/carbon-balanced) - Hmm... not much detail on the projects?

https://carbonfund.org/individuals/

http://sustainabletravel.org/


## Carbon Offset Providers

[Atmosfair](https://www.atmosfair.de/en/home/) - German provider. Uses Clean Development Mechanism "Gold Standard?". No annual reports since 2014???

[United Airlines](http://co2offsets.sustainabletravelinternational.org/ua/offsets) - United will calculate your carbon footprint and suggested monetary offset based off routes. Its route selection is a bit limited, but you can find comparable routes to your own to get a rough estimate. It offers two offset projects, a wind farm in Texas and a reforestation project in Peru through a partner, Sustainable Travel International. Both projects are under the [Verified Carbon Standard](http://www.v-c-s.org/project/vcs-program/).
