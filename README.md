# carbonoffsets

We created this guide to hopefully inspire you to offset the emissions of some of the traveling you've done during your Fulbright year. It contains information on carbon offsetting, some background on standards, some articles about the debate surrounding offsetting, and some offset providers that we recommend. It is by no means comprehensive, so we recommend you do your own research if you're intersted! And remember, the best thing we can do is reduce our own emissions (minimise flying and driving, eat more local food, and so on). But acknowledging that minimising our emissions to zero is not yet possible or preferable, carbon offsetting can help create some good to counteract the bad :)
