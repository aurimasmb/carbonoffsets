# Policy

The EU has included commercial aviation as part of its [Emissions Trading System](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets_en), a Cap-and-Trade system, [since 2008 (or 2012??)](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets_en). Recently, the rules were changed so that the ETS cap and trade system only applied to flights within the EEA. This is to allow for a global aviation emissions limitation program called [CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation)](https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Pages/market-based-measures.aspx). CORSIA is an offsets program which requires airlines in countries in participating countries to purchase carbon offsets for any emissions increases after 2020. Participation by countries is on a voluntary basis, [and will start in 2021.](http://atwonline.com/regulatory-data/corsia-timeline)

_**Auri's opinion:** This legislation seems super weak. **Offsetting** the **growth** of emissions after **2020**?? That's a pretty lame goal. Does this mean that we as citizens should try to do more to reduce/offset our personal impact, because clearly the legislation is not going to do much, and certainly won't do much for a while?_
