# Offsets


Offsets should be:

* real
* measurable
* additional
* permanent
* leakage
* unique
* independently verified

OK. 

Major question: 

**What is the return period on the offsets we are buying?**

Kolvidur was a 90-year return period.


**"Crediting Period"** - The period of time during which emissions reductions can be proved to have existed.


Sequestering vs. Avoiding


Projects are **Validated** ??

Credits are **Verified** after the offset have occurred.

## Forward-Selling / Forward-Purchasing

Excellent overview of emissions credits purchasing options:

Question: how do we know if we are purchasing offsets which have occurred?

I guess you just always have to check the vintage of the emissions offsets that you are purchasing. If the vintage is from the previous year or earlier, you know that the offsets have already taken place.


## Sequestering:

Ok. Interesting point about sequestration projects. In an avoidance project, you can never lose the emissions reductions associated with the reduced rate of emissions that existed during the crediting period of the credits. With a sequestration project however, someone could still burn the carbon offsets which you paid for. There must be additional safeguards, essentially for eternity, that ensure that this carbon is never burned. 

### Forestry

OK, so looks like VCS is only issuing offsets for actual carbon that has been sequestered over 1 year period due to increases in sequestration rates associated with planting minus up to the amount that is expected to remain in the stand even after a forestry harvest.

**Question: is this modelling a type of forestry which leaves a certain number of trees standing? Or is this residual carbon the result of soil carbon increases? If it is residual carbon in standing trees, what if someone clearfelled the stand?**


## Avoiding:

Here is an example project which uses lightweight pallets to reduce emissions during transport:
