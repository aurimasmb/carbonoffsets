Dear 2016-2017 Fulbrighters,

Congratulations on finishing your Fulbright year! 
It's been a pleasure and an honor to be able to meet you and share the experiences of this past year together - we wish you the best in whatever your next steps are!

If your Fulbright year was at all like ours, you likely did a lot of long-distance travelling, mostly by plane. We are concerned about the carbon dioxide emissions we produced over the course of this year, and wanted to explore ways in which we could offset this impact.

We have spent the last few months researching voluntary carbon offsetting as a way to offset carbon emissions from hard-to-avoid emissions, such as flying to see family and friends.

Based on this research, we have put together a Wiki for Fulbrighters interested in offsetting their personal emissions from their Fulbright year.
