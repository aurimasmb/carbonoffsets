# Notes

_This is where we store temporary notes from ongoing research. See the notes contained in the relevant directories for what we have learned so far. See the Wiki for a pared down version of this._

### Todo List (19 July 2017) - a few more hours work.

1. ~~Email United again to check about their prices and retirement scheme.~~
2. Prepare simple Wiki for Fulbrighters interested in learning more about offsetting:
  * Finish Standards Page -- Auri
  * Evaluate more retailers:
    * ClimateNeutralNow (CDM) -- Auri
    * CarbonFootprint.com (VCS, Gold Standard, CDM?) -- Michael
    * Any others?
  * Finish Home Page FAQ's -- Both
  * Finish Policy page: 
    * Brief summary of ETS / CORSIA. -- Auri
  * Organise more detailed / in-depth Notes page. -- Michael
3. Draft Email to Fulbrighters, directing them to BP Target Neutral?

### Introduction

Most of what we do emits greenhouse gas emissions (A.K.A. carbon emissions) in some form: carbon dioxide, methane, or even water vapor. A carbon offset is a way to diminish carbon emissions elsewhere even as we increase them through our activities. As Fulbrighters, one of our biggest sources of emissions is flying. To offset these emissions, we calculate our emissions (see "Calculating carbon emissions"), then pay a corresponding amount to a carbon offset provider (see "Carbon Offset Providers"). Most of these providers either create a carbon sink by planting trees or diminish future emissions by developing renewable energy. The latter projects often bring about social benefits by providing clean development and jobs in the host community. Just below are some sources describing carbon offsets (and some potential controversies around them).

### Unsorted Links

[Carbon Offset Research & Education (CORE)](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/index.html) offers thorough information about carbon offsetting (but note that it was last updated in 2011!).

[CORE - Are Carbon offsets a scam?](http://www.co2offsetresearch.org/consumer/GoodorBad.html) - Great article addressing key arguments for and against offsetting.

[IATA](http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/environment/Documents/carbon-offset-guidelines-may2008.pdf) offers another guide all about carbon offsetting, specifically from an aviation angle.

["On the flight path to global meltdown" in The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/sep/21/travelsenvironmentalimpact.ethicalliving) - This article by George Monbiot offers a more extreme argument: that we must halt our air travel pretty much altogether.

["A complete guide to carbon offsetting"](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/16/carbon-offset-projects-carbon-emissions) or ["How can I offset my flight emissions?"](http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/apr/19/how-to-offset-flight-emissions), both from The Guardian.
